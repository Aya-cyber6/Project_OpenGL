# Project_OpenGL

This project renders a 3D scene inspired by **Sonic Adventure**, featuring models such as Station Square Chao Garden and Tails (Miles). It uses modern OpenGL with shaders, camera movement, lighting, and model loading.
Here is a detailed report about the project: [RAPOR.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20131026/RAPOR.pdf)

## ‚ú® Features

- First-person camera with mouse and keyboard input  
- Directional lighting with ambient, diffuse, and specular components  
- Model loading using Assimp (Sonic, Tailsü¶ä, and the stage)  
- Custom GLSL shaders  
- Depth testing for realistic rendering

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies

Make sure the following libraries are installed and properly linked:

- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/)  
- [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/)  
- [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)  
- [Assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Project_OpenGL
   cd Project_OpenGL
   ```

2. Configure your Visual Studio project:

   - Go to **Project ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Configuration Properties ‚Üí VC++ Directories**  
     Add the paths to your `Include` and `Library` directories.

   - Then go to **Linker ‚Üí Input ‚Üí Additional Dependencies**  
     Add the following:  
     `opengl32.lib; glfw3.lib; assimp-vc143-mt.lib;`

   - This project was built using **Active(Debug)** configuration for **All Platforms**, but feel free to use what's compatible with your system.
